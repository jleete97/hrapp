## Maven configuration

*Caveat: these directions are my notes, which worked for me. YMMV.*

Download and install Maven. I have it in /usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.2.5.

Download and install the NEXUS repository manager. I have it in ~/tools/nexus-2.11.2-03/, though I should
probably have it in /usr/local somewhere. To run it, go to the bin subdirectory, and execute ./nexus start &.
